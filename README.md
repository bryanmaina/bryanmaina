# Hi there üëã

My name is Bryan, I'm 32 years old and I live in Belgium.

My hobbies include debugging code that should work, explaining what I do to my bewildered relatives, and occasionally remembering to blink. If you see me staring blankly into space, don't worry ‚Äì I'm just compiling thoughts.

# Work ? ü§ù

I've been professionally coding for 7+ years, but my keyboard and I go way back ‚Äì think 18 years as hobbyists before I even considered it a career!¬†Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from Delphi, VB.NET, jQuery, Reading books, the great LAMP stack¬† plague, AngularJS(not Angular), Java Applets, servlets, the blues screen, SVN repos. In the ancient times, if you were a web developer¬†or aspired to be one, life sucked really bad because of Internet explorer.

In 2025, you might catch me indulging in what some call 'unemployed adult activities': Rust programming. I'm here, wrestling with lifetimes, celebrating successful compiles, and generally just reveling in the sheer elegance and power of Rust.
